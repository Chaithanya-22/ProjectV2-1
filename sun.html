    <h2>Overview of Sun</h2>
    <p>
      The Sun is the center of our solar system and is a nearly perfect sphere
      of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. With a diameter
      of about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), it is over 109 times the
      size of Earth. The Sun’s immense gravitational pull keeps the planets,
      including Earth, in orbit. Its core reaches temperatures of approximately
      15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), where nuclear
      fusion occurs, generating the energy that fuels the Sun and radiates out
      into space.
    </p>
    <h2>Importance for Life</h2>
    <p>
      The Sun plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth. It provides the
      light and warmth necessary for photosynthesis, enabling plants to grow and
      produce oxygen. The Sun’s energy drives weather patterns and ocean
      currents, influencing our climate and ecosystems. Without the Sun, Earth
      would be a frozen, lifeless planet, underscoring its importance in
      maintaining the delicate balance of life.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Understanding</h2>
    <p>
      Scientific exploration of the Sun has advanced significantly with missions
      like NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These
      missions aim to study solar activity, such as solar flares and coronal
      mass ejections, which can affect space weather and satellite
      communications on Earth. Understanding the Sun is crucial for predicting
      its behavior and ensuring the safety of our technological infrastructure.
