    <h2>Overview of Mars</h2>
    <p>
      Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due
      to its iron oxide-rich soil, giving it a distinct reddish appearance. It
      has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers, making it roughly half the size
      of Earth. Mars features the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus
      Mons, and a vast canyon system, Valles Marineris, which is over 4,000
      kilometers long. Its diverse geology provides valuable insights into its
      history and potential for past life.
    </p>
    <h2>Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces
      of nitrogen and argon. This sparse atmosphere results in significant
      temperature fluctuations, averaging around -63°C (-81°F). Dust storms can
      envelop the planet, sometimes lasting for months and affecting surface
      visibility. Despite these harsh conditions, evidence suggests that liquid
      water once flowed on Mars, leading to speculation about its capacity to
      support life in its ancient past.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
      Mars has been the focus of extensive exploration, with missions like
      NASA’s Perseverance rover and the Mars Curiosity rover paving the way for
      future discoveries. These missions aim to search for signs of past
      microbial life and gather data on the planet's geology and climate. As
      humanity looks toward potential colonization, Mars remains a primary
      candidate for future manned missions, holding the promise of expanding our
      understanding of life beyond Earth.
