    <h2>Overview of Earth</h2>
    <p>
      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body
      to support life. With a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers, it is the
      largest of the terrestrial planets. Composed mainly of rock and metal,
      Earth has a diverse landscape that includes mountains, valleys, oceans,
      and deserts. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of approximately 150
      million kilometers, completing a revolution every 365.25 days, which
      defines our calendar year.
    </p>

    <h2>Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Earth's atmosphere, composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace
      amounts of other gases, plays a crucial role in sustaining life. It
      protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps regulate
      temperature. The climate varies across the globe, influenced by factors
      such as latitude, elevation, and ocean currents. This diversity creates a
      range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to arid deserts, each home
      to unique flora and fauna.
    </p>
    <h2>Human Impact and Future</h2>
    <p>
      Human activity has significantly impacted Earthâ€™s environment, leading to
      challenges such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution. These
      issues highlight the importance of sustainable practices and conservation
      efforts. As we explore space and seek potential habitats beyond Earth, it
      remains vital to protect our planet, ensuring a healthy environment for
      future generations while fostering a deeper understanding of our place in
      the universe.
