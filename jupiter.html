    <h2>Overview of Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
      Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a gas giant with a
      diameter of about 139,822 kilometers, more than 11 times that of Earth.
      Known for its prominent bands of clouds and Great Red Spot—a massive storm
      larger than Earth—Jupiter captivates astronomers with its dynamic
      atmosphere. Its composition primarily includes hydrogen and helium, with
      trace amounts of methane, water vapor, and ammonia, creating a vibrant and
      turbulent environment.
    </p>
    <h2>Moons and Rings</h2>
    <p>
      Jupiter boasts an impressive collection of moons, with 79 confirmed
      satellites, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io,
      Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Each of these moons exhibits unique
      geological features; for example, Io is the most volcanically active body
      in the solar system, while Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean,
      making it a prime candidate for potential extraterrestrial life. Jupiter
      also has a faint ring system, primarily composed of dust particles and
      small rocks, which adds to its allure.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Jupiter has been explored by several spacecraft, including NASA's Juno
      mission, which studies its atmosphere and magnetic field. These missions
      provide critical insights into the formation and evolution of the solar
      system. Understanding Jupiter's complex weather patterns and its massive
      gravitational influence helps scientists learn more about planetary
      systems, making it a key focus for ongoing astronomical research.
