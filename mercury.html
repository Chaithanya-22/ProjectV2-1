    <h2>Overview of Mercury</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the solar
      system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It orbits the Sun at an
      average distance of approximately 57.9 million kilometers and completes
      one revolution in just 88 Earth days. Due to its proximity to the Sun,
      Mercury experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from
      scorching highs of about 430°C (800°F) during the day to freezing lows of
      -180°C (-290°F) at night.
    </p>
    <h2>Surface and Composition</h2>
    <p>
      The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, resembling that of the Moon,
      and features large cliffs known as "lobate scarps." These cliffs are
      thought to be the result of the planet's contraction as it cooled.
      Mercury's composition is primarily metallic, with a large iron core that
      makes up about 75% of its volume. The thin atmosphere, composed mostly of
      oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, and helium, is insufficient to retain heat,
      contributing to the planet’s extreme temperature variations.
    </p>
    <h2>Exploration and Mysteries</h2>
    <p>
      Mercury has been visited by two spacecraft: Mariner 10 and MESSENGER.
      MESSENGER provided invaluable data about the planet’s geology and magnetic
      field. Despite these explorations, many mysteries remain, such as the
      nature of its core and the existence of ice in permanently shadowed
      craters. Understanding Mercury is crucial for comprehending the formation
      and evolution of the inner solar system.
