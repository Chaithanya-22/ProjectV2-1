    <h2>Overview of Saturn</h2>
    <p>
      Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring
      system, which is the most extensive and intricate in our solar system.
      With a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers, it is the second-largest
      planet, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Saturn’s low
      density—less than that of water—indicates that it is mostly gaseous, with
      a possible rocky core. Its striking yellowish hue is due to ammonia
      crystals in its upper atmosphere.
    </p>
    <h2>Rings and Moons</h2>
    <p>
      Saturn's iconic rings are made up of countless ice and rock particles,
      ranging in size from tiny grains to massive boulders. These rings are
      divided into several distinct sections, with the A, B, and C rings being
      the most prominent. In addition to its rings, Saturn has over 80 known
      moons, including Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and
      features a thick atmosphere and liquid lakes of methane. This diverse moon
      system adds to Saturn’s intrigue and complexity.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Research</h2>
    <p>
      Saturn has been studied by various missions, notably NASA’s Cassini
      spacecraft, which orbited the planet from 2004 to 2017, providing
      unprecedented data about its rings and moons. This mission revealed
      valuable insights into the planet's atmospheric dynamics, magnetic field,
      and the possibility of life on Titan. Ongoing research aims to deepen our
      understanding of Saturn’s formation and its role within the solar system,
      making it a key focus for planetary science.
