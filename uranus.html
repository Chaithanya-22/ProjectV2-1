    <h2>Overview of Uranus</h2>
    <p>
      Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is unique among the gas giants
      due to its distinctive blue-green color, which results from methane in its
      atmosphere. With a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers, it is the
      third-largest planet in the solar system. Uranus is notable for its
      extreme axial tilt of approximately 98 degrees, causing it to rotate
      almost on its side. This unusual orientation leads to extreme seasonal
      variations as it orbits the Sun every 84 Earth years.
    </p>
    <h2>Atmosphere and Rings</h2>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of Uranus is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and
      methane, giving it a striking bluish hue. Its weather patterns include
      strong winds and a variety of cloud formations. Uranus also has a faint
      ring system, composed of dark, narrow rings made up of ice and rock
      particles. These rings are less prominent than those of Saturn, yet they
      add to the planet's enigmatic character and provide clues about its
      formation.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Discoveries</h2>
    <p>
      Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, NASA’s Voyager 2, which
      flew by in 1986. This encounter revealed many of the planet’s secrets,
      including its complex atmosphere, ring system, and numerous moons. Ongoing
      research focuses on understanding Uranus's unique features and potential
      for future exploration, highlighting its importance in the study of our
      solar system's diversity.
