    <h2>Overview of the Moon</h2>
    <p>
      The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, orbits our planet at an average
      distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles). With a diameter of
      approximately 3,474 kilometers, it is the fifth-largest moon in the solar
      system. The Moon's surface is characterized by impact craters, lunar maria
      (dark basaltic plains), and highlands, showcasing a history shaped by
      geological and cosmic events. Its gravitational influence plays a crucial
      role in creating ocean tides on Earth.
    </p>
    <h2>Phases and Atmosphere</h2>
    <p>
      The Moon goes through distinct phases—new moon, waxing crescent, first
      quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, and waning phases—due to its position
      relative to Earth and the Sun. Despite its significance, the Moon has a
      very thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere, composed primarily of
      hydrogen, helium, and trace gases. This lack of atmosphere means that
      temperatures on the Moon can fluctuate dramatically, ranging from about
      -173°C (-280°F) during the night to 127°C (260°F) during the day.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
      The Moon has been the target of human exploration since the Apollo
      missions, with Apollo 11 marking the first manned moon landing in 1969.
      Ongoing interest in lunar exploration includes plans for future missions,
      such as NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon
      and establish a sustainable presence. These efforts not only seek to
      enhance our understanding of the Moon but also serve as a stepping stone
      for future missions to Mars and beyond.
