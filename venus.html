    <h2>Overview of Venus</h2>
    <p>
      Venus, often referred to as Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet
      from the Sun. It is similar in size and composition to Earth, featuring a
      rocky surface and a metallic core. However, its environment is drastically
      different, characterized by extreme temperatures and dense atmospheric
      pressure. With an average surface temperature of about 467°C (872°F),
      Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, a result of a runaway
      greenhouse effect.
    </p>
    <h2>Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of Venus is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with
      clouds of sulfuric acid, making it highly corrosive and opaque. This thick
      atmosphere contributes to its intense greenhouse effect, trapping heat and
      preventing it from escaping into space. The atmospheric pressure on Venus
      is about 92 times that of Earth, comparable to being nearly a kilometer
      underwater. These harsh conditions pose significant challenges for
      exploration and understanding of the planet.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Significance</h2>
    <p>
      Venus has been a target for numerous space missions, including NASA’s
      Magellan and ESA’s Venus Express, which provided valuable data about its
      surface and atmosphere. Understanding Venus not only sheds light on its
      own geology and climate but also offers insights into Earth’s future,
      particularly regarding climate change and planetary evolution. As
      scientists continue to study Venus, its mysteries may reveal important
      lessons about our own planet.
