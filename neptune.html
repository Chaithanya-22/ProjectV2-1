    <h2>Overview of Neptune</h2>
    <p>
      Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is known for its
      striking deep blue color, which is primarily due to the presence of
      methane in its atmosphere. With a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers, it
      is the fourth-largest planet in the solar system. Discovered in 1846,
      Neptune is classified as an ice giant, composed mainly of hydrogen,
      helium, and ices such as water, ammonia, and methane. Its distance from
      the Sun results in an extremely cold atmosphere, with average temperatures
      around -214°C (-353°F).
    </p>
    <h2>Atmosphere and Weather</h2>
    <p>
      Neptune’s atmosphere is characterized by dynamic weather patterns,
      including the fastest winds recorded in the solar system, reaching speeds
      of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour). The planet
      exhibits large storm systems, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot,
      including the notable Great Dark Spot observed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft
      in 1989. These storms and changing weather patterns highlight Neptune's
      complex and active atmosphere.
    </p>

    <h2>Exploration and Research</h2>
    <p>
      Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which provided
      valuable data about its atmosphere, rings, and moons. The mission revealed
      the planet’s intricate weather systems and confirmed the presence of
      several moons, including Triton, which has geysers of nitrogen gas.
      Ongoing studies of Neptune focus on understanding its formation and
      evolution, offering insights into the characteristics of distant
      exoplanets.
